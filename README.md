`pew_experiment.Rmd` contains a basic experiment comparing simple distribution regression to group means and logistic regression using publicly available survey microdata from Pew Research (ex. https://www.people-press.org/dataset/september-2018-political-survey/).  The notebook can be viewed [here](https://vcbradley.github.io/bdr/pew-experiment/pew_experiment.html).

[`pew-experiment/bagging_analysis.Rmd`](https://vcbradley.github.io/bdr/pew-experiment/bagging_analysis.html) contains analysis on how to create bags of outcome variables

`functions.R` - contains the functions to perform basic distribution regression called in the notebooks
