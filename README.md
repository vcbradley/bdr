## Distribution regression for individual-level prediction

`pew-experiment/pew_experiment.Rmd` contains a basic experiment comparing simple distribution regression to group means and logistic regression using publicly available survey microdata from Pew Research (ex. https://www.people-press.org/dataset/september-2018-political-survey/).  The notebook can be viewed [here](https://vcbradley.github.io/bdr/pew-experiment/pew_experiment.html).

`pew-experiment/bagging-analysis.Rmd` contains analysis on how to create bags of outcome variables.  Viewed [here](https://vcbradley.github.io/bdr/pew-experiment/bagging-analysis.html)

`kernel-mean-matching.Rmd` implements basic kernel mean matching [this paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~arthurg/papers/covariateShiftChapter.pdf) by Arthur Gretton.  Notebook can be viewed [here](https://vcbradley.github.io/bdr/kernel-mean-matching.html)

`functions.R` - contains the functions to perform basic distribution regression called in the notebooks
